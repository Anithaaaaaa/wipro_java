    <p>Hover around the center—two areas overlap with different links.</p>

  <!-- Overlapping rectangles: the one placed FIRST wins when areas overlap -->
  <area shape="rect" coords="140,60,260,140" href="https://example.com/first" alt="First link">
  <area shape="rect" coords="180,80,300,160" href="https://example.com/second" alt="Second link">

    <!-- Tip: Try clicking inside the overlap (roughly 180–260 x 80–140) -->
